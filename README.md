For the id i find it is quicker to work with numbers rather than strings. For example my id is sdi2000071. When i login via the code the menu asks for my id, then if it finds it it asks for a password. When asked for the id i write sdi2000071 but the code ignores the sdi and just reads 2000071 as its own unique number.
