# phase2

For the id i find it is quicker to work with numbers rather than strings. For example my id is sdi2000071. When i login via the code the menu asks for my id, then if it finds it it asks for a password. When asked for the id i write sdi2000071 but the code ignores the sdi and just reads 2000071 as its own unique number.

For the semesters. I know there are 8 of them. 2 is just simpler to showcase the code works and to be honest intialising all the semesters is mute work(and im kinda lazy). So we got 2 semesters with 2 courses each to show the code works. If it shows 8 semesters it means i found the time between studying for the exams to initialise all of them, otherwise theyre 2.
